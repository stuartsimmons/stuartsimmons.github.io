# stuartsimmons.github.io

AR.js for [SMv](https://kait909.wixsite.com/infosys220) as part of Group 43's group project for INFOSYS220 at the University of Auckland during semester 1 of 2019.

Pages meant to be viewed on mobile devices within the context of this project's scope.

[View layout page](stuartsimmons.github.io/view-layout.html) will be utilised by Moving Staff of SMv to view the layout of a truck to see where all objects as part of the move job go. This page acts as the dynamic function for use case #4 of this assignment.

[Measure page](stuartsimmons.github.io/measure.html) will be utilised by clients and moving staff of SMv in order to measure objects for registration to a job's inventory. This page is part of the static functions for use case #4 of this assignment. This page does not have full functionality and is only for the purposes of representing the function rather than completing the function.

When accessing this page using an iOS device you must use Safari. This is due to limitations on camera access for other browsers (such as Chrome) on iOS imposed by Apple. This works on all iPhones back to the 5s, but may still work on older devices.

When accessing this page using an Android device Firefox is preferred. Firefox worked on 100% of the devices tested. Chrome may have issues with some devices, but generally worked on most tested devices (barring a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and a Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra). Other browsers also tended to work the majority of the time. Tested working on all browsers on Samsung Galaxy S3, not guaranteed to work on older devices.
